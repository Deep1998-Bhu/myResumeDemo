        <b> Data science</b> is an interdisciplinary academic<sup>[1]</sup>.
        <br/>
       <b>Data science</b>  also integrates domain knowledge from the underlying application domain (e.g., natural sciences, information technology, and medicine).<sup>[3] </sup>Data science is multifaceted and can be described as a science, a research paradigm, a research method, a discipline, a workflow, and a profession.<sup>[4] </sup>
    </p>

    <p><b> Data science</b> is "a concept to unify statistics, data analysis,
         informatics, and their related methods" to <mark>"understand and analyze
             actual phenomena" </mark>with data.
        <sup>[5] </sup> It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields
         within  the context of
      <del>mathematics, statistics, computer science</del>, information science, 
      and domain knowledge.
        <sup>[6] </sup> However, <u><mark><b>data science is different from computer science</b></mark></u>
         and information science. Turing Award winner Jim Gray imagined data science 
         as a<mark> "fourth paradigm" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational, 
            and now data-driven) and asserted that "everything about science is changing
             because of the impact of information technology" and the data deluge</mark>.
             <sup>[7] </sup>
        <sup>[8] </sup>
        A data scientist is a professional who creates programming code and combines
         it with statistical knowledge to summarize data.<sup>[9] </sup>
